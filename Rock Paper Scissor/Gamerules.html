    <p class="rules-text">
      Rock Paper Scissors is a zero sum game that is usually played by two
      people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an
      outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and
      will lead to an outcome.

    <p class="rules-text">
      Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are
      pretty simple. The game is played where players deliver hand signals that
      will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The
      outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:
      <ul id="rules">
        <li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
        <li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
        <li>Paper wins against rock.</li>
      </ul>
