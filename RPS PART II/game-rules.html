        <p class="rules-text">
          Rock Paper Scissors is a zero sum game that is usually played by two
          people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an
          outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and
          will lead to an outcome.

        <h1 class="rule-titles">What are the rules of RPS?</h1>
        <p class="rules-text">
          Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are
          pretty simple. The game is played where players deliver hand signals that
          will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The
          outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:
          <ul id="rules">
            <li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
            <li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
            <li>Paper wins against rock.</li>
          </ul>
